/* tndqcosy - double quantum filtered cosy experiment
               using obs xmtr for presaturation during presat period
               and d2, if desired 
              TRANSMITTER MUST BY AT SOLVENT FREQUENCY

  Parameters:

         pw = 90 excitation pulse (at power level tpwr)
      phase =   0: P-type non-phase-sensitive experiment
              1,2: hypercomplex phase-sensitive experiment
                3: TPPI phase-sensitive experiment
   satmode  = 'yn' for saturation during relaxation period
              'ny' for saturation during d2
              'yy' for both
     satdly = presaturation period -uses obs xmtr at tof with satpwr; 
      sspul = 'y': selects for Trim(x)-Trim(y)
               sequence at start of pulse sequence
             (highly recommended to eliminate "long T1" artifacts)
