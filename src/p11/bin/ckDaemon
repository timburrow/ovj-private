   # I cannot figure out how to get get ps in Linux to give the actual
   # name of the scanlog process.  However, the pid of the process is
   # saved by S99scanlog when it starts scanlog.  It is saved in
   # /vnmr/adm/scanlogpid.  We will just check to see if that pid is
   # still a running pid.  If so, it must be running.
   
   # Get the pid
   pid=`cat /vnmr/adm/scanlogpid`

   # Have ps only output the pid
   scankey=`ps -o pid | grep $pid`
