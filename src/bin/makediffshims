# creates 68020 version on the SUN-3; SPARC version on the SUN-4
# this capability works by having the `make' program itself do
# a `make' when the target is `diffshims'; the lower level target is
# `diffshims_sun3' or `diffshims_sun4'.  The actual program created is
# always `diffshims' though.  The system type is appended so as to
# avoid unending recursion (`diffshims' uses `diffshims' as a target
# which has `diffshims' as a target etc.)
#
# At this time the makediffshims file assumes the VNMR libraries are
# up to date.

#---------  SCCS ----------------

# make's -e flag is also needed here so as to override the default
# definitions and extract the latest source files from SCCS
#
# effect is to
# 1.  change directory to /common/sysbin
# 2.  excute make to update any changes in SCCS not present in /common/sysbin
#
# This is done with the "dummy" object `src'.  This object is dependent on the
# source files, so they become the real objects.  The symbol ALLSRC is only
# known after `make' has read this file. A new invokation of `make' is required
# for the activity is (most likely) to take place in a different directory.
# `make' cannot have as a target a UNIX file path; only a file name.  Thus the
# dummy object `src'.
#
# This operation requires the copy of makefile in /common/sysbin contain `src'
# as a target !!!
#
# define SRC_DIR to be "./" when testing this...
