rtjeol  - retrieve Jeol data

The rtjeol macro converts 1D Jeol Delta data into a form usable by Vnmr.
It then reads that data into the current experiment.
It uses the jread command to read the converted file. The first
argument to jread is the name of the converted file, generated
by the rtjeol macro. An optional second argument to jread, as in
jread(fiename,'rev') will negate the imaging channel of the FID
data, thereby reversing the frequency axis of the spectrum.
