 p11_action - Set and query P11 options
*****************************************************************************

When the "Secure Environments" option is active, a dataID can be displayed
plotted with a spectrum of FID.  The p11_action command can modify that
behavior. 

p11_action('showDataID',1)  Turn on the display and plotting of the dataID
p11_action('showDataID',0)  Turn off the display and plotting of the dataID

p11_action('showDataID'):$state will return a 1 or 0 to $state, depending
on whether the dataID will be shown or not, respectively.

By default, the display of the dataID is on. If the "Secure Environments"
administrator wants to have it off by default, they can issue the following
command from a shelltool
   touch /vnmr/p11/dataID_off
To turn it back on as the default, they can issue the following
command from a shelltoll.
   rm -f /vnmr/p11/dataID_off

If the owner of an automation run did not want to use the current default, they
could put a login macro in the private maclib with either
p11_action('showDataID',1)
or
p11_action('showDataID',0)
to select their choice.
