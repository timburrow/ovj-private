All six of these parameters are in the processing group.  phfid, lsfid,
and lsfrq operate on complex "np" FID data, referred to as the t2 dimen-
sion in a 2D experiment or as the t3 dimension in a 3D experiment.  The
parameters phfid1, lsfid1, and lsfrq1 operate on "ni" interferogram data,
both hypercomplex and complex.  "ni" interferogram data are referred to
as the t1 dimension in both a 2D and a 3D experiment.  phfid2, lsfid2,
and lsfrq2 operate on "ni2" interferogram data, both hypercomplex and
complex.  "ni2" interferogram data are referred to as the t2 dimension
in a 3D experiment.  All six of these parameters are properly handled
by a WTI operation (display), i.e., a WTI operation on an "ni" inter-
ferogram applies the parameters phfid1, lsfid1, and lsfrq1, if selected,
to the time-domain data prior to the Fourier transformation.

phfid, phfid1, and phfid2 can take values from -360.0 to +360.0 and spec-
ify the angle of zero-order rotation in degrees.  This zero-order rotation
is executed as a part of retrieving the time-domain data into the active
region of the VNMR memory and can be used instead of "rp" (phfid), "rp1"
"rp1" (phfid1), or "rp2" (phfid2) applied to the frequency-domain data.
lsfrq, lsfrq1, and lsfrq2 are the time-domain equivalents of "lp", "lp1",
and "lp2" within VNMR and result in a frequency shift of the spectral data.
phfid is used only in a complex phase rotation; phfid1 and phfid2 are
used in a complex phase rotation for complex t1/t2 interferograms and in
a hypercomplex phase rotation for hypercomplex t1/t2 interferograms.

lsfid can take values from -fn/2 to np/2 (or -fn/2 to fn/2 if fn < np)
and specifies the number of complex points (not real points) that the
"np" FID is to be either left-shifted (lsfid > 0) or right-shifted (lsfid
< 0).  lsfid1 can take values from -fn1/2 to ni (or -fn1/2 to fn1/2 if
fn1 < 2*ni) and specifies the number of hypercomplex (for hypercomplex
interferogram data) or complex (for complex interferogram data) points
that the "ni" interferogram is to be either left-shifted (lsfid1 > 0) or
right-shifted (lsfid1 < 0).  lsfid2 can take values from -fn2/2 to ni2
(or -fn2/2 to fn2/2 if fn2 < 2*ni2) and specifies the number of hypercom-
plex (for hypercomplex interferogram data) or complex (for complex inter-
ferogram data) points that the "ni2" interferogram is to be either left-
shifted (lsfid2  > 0) or right-shifted (lsfid2 < 0).

lsfrq, lsfrq1, and lsfrq2 can in principle take any real value, either
positive or negative.  A negative value results in peaks being shifted
upfield (to the right); a positive value, in peaks being shifted down-
field (to the left).  These 3 parameters store the value of the frequency
shift in Hz.


******************************************************************************
 
The lsfid command will either left-shift (points>0) or right-shift (points<0)
an FID.  A right shift adds zeros to the front of the FID. The points argument
in the number of complex points (real and imaginary) to shift.

An optional second argument specifies the filename of an FID file.
If there is no second argument, lsfid will shift the FID
in the current experiment.

If an optional second argument is given and if there is a procpar in the
same directory, the "np" and "at" parameters in that procpar will be updated.
Also, the "lsfid" parameter in that procpar will be set to "Not used".

If no second argument is given, the "current" and "processed" values
of "np" and "at" parameters will be updated. The "lsfid" parameter
will be set to "Not used".

If no second argument is given, this command will overwrite acqfil/fid
and acqfil/procpar in curexp.  If acqfil/fid is linked to a saved fid file,
the link will be replaced by a copy, so the original fid will not be overwritten.
 
This command can be repeated to further shift the fid.

Examples:

 lsfid(2)   // left-shift FID in current experiment by 2 complex data points.
 lsfid(-3,userdir+'/data/myfid.fid/fid') // right-shift FID in saved data set
